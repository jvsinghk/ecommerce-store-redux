/*
Extra Credit:
1. Create a function called searchTermReducer that can handle the following action types:
    * 'searchTerm/setSearchTerm'
    * 'searchTerm/clearSearchTerm'
    * Don't forget to set the initial state and return state by default!

2. Create a function called setSearchTerm
    * It has one parameter, term
    * It returns an action object whose payload is the term value
    * See SearchTerm.js for how this will be used.

3. Create a function called clearSearchTerm
    * It returns an action object with no payload
    * See SearchTerm.js for how this will be used.
